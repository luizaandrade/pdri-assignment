Data description
==========================================

# Are covariates balances across treatment groups?

```{r}
data %>%
  select(
    treat,
    prior_arrests,
    race,
    gender,
    age
  ) %>%
  sumtable(group = "treat", group.test = TRUE)
```

***

The data is balanced on gender and race, but not on age or prior arrests
